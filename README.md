# A Study of RISK

This study is a personal exploration into the game of RISK. It is meant mostly as an excercise in probability, statistics, game theory, and reinforcement learning, but will be aimed towards the curious gamesman or gameswoman. I will seperate topics into different jupyter notebooks that I am calling chapters. Each notebook is meant to be a standalone chapter in this study, however, later notebooks may use ideas developed in previous sections, so I recommend that you read them in order. My goal is to provide information and insights into the game of RISK that are easy to follow and accessible to anyone, regardless of prior technical knowledge.

In this study I plan on covering the following strategic ideas:

1. Probabilities of winning / losing attacks + expected amount of remaining troops
2. What do wars mean and when do you want to attack?
3. What are best the starting countries / continents?
4. What are best long term countries / continents?
5. How does gameplay change with player number?
6. What are the best piece layouts / attack paths?

This project is a **work in progress**! I will add chapters as they are completed, and reserve the right to go back and modify old ones. Enjoy :)

### Chapter 1:
In this jupyter notebook I begin to explore a fundemental component of RISK: the attack. I derive formulas that give probabilities of outcomes of battles, and use them to analyse various battle sequences and strategies. I use these results to construct visualizations that build intuition and give insight into how attacks work. Finally, I find an easy to use formula that approximates the probability of winning an attack as a function of attackers and defenders.
